        <p>
            I'm from Chengdu, China, a city famous for its spicy cuisine. I'm sure a lot of people have heard of hotpot.
            <br><br>
            I was born on June 3 (Gemini), and my MBTI personality type is INTP. I speak Chinese and English.
            I like photography, especially landscapes, and I'm passionate about video games.

        <h3>My Goals</h3>
        <p>
            I started with a major in accounting but soon realized my passion lies in media and photography.
            Capturing moments and creating unique content excites me.
            <br><br>
            I aim to pursue a career in media production, learning digital production techniques and understanding
            audience preferences. After completing my master's degree, I hope to work in media or explore
            professional fragrance blending.
